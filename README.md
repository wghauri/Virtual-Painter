# Virtual Painter
This project captures the webcam and tracks the user's hand movements, allowing the 
person to use hand motions to draw on the screen. I used a hand detection module 
to track the user's hands, and through tracking the hand landmarks, the index finger
is able to act as a drawing tool.
